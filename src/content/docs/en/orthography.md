## Noramalization Principles

Our guidelines aim for a **normalized transcription**, meaning that words that have been corrupted in their lexical, phonological, or morphological form are corrected in the transcription. This is done by checking any single word against a dictionary. Any corrections made are noted in a separate commentary. However, any **nonstandard syntactical phenomena** (features of Middle Arabic linguistic register) are left unchanged. This is different from a **diplomatic transcription**, which replicates the manuscript exactly.

## Punctuation

- Do **not** use any punctuation.
- Avoid extended spaces between words.

## Diacritics (Letter Points)

Follow the standards of classical Arabic. Complete missing diacritics including in the _tā marbūṭa_ (except in foreign names; leave these exactly as in the manuscript).

## _Hamazāt_

TBA

## _Taškīl_

- Always write _šaddas_, except after _al-lām aš-šamsiyya_.
- Do not use any other _taškīl_ signs.
